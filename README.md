# nvim-dotfiles

Sorry VS Code it has been a good run but I am joinig the dark side. 

Here are my config files for neovim for 2025. I will likely be updating these to include better linting and autofill for certain languages but for now it is bearable with the following plugins:
- catppuccin (don't rlly use)
- completions
- harpoon 
- lsp-config
- lualine
- luarocks
- neo-tree
- neuroterm 
- nvim-tmux-navigator
- telescope
- treesitter
- undotree
- vim-fugitive

With linting for (will update with more):
- Python 
- Lua
